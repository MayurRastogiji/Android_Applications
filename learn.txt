**Intent Passing**


it is the procedure via which we can change screen in our android application using any event listner or on the basis of any particular logic.
.) Intent abc = new Intent(`fromclass`.this,`toclass`.class);
the above line is used to create an intent.
.) startActivity(`intent_name`);
the above code is responsible for changing screen


**Bundle Passing**


it is the procedure via which we can send and receive content from 1 java file to another via intent
.) `intent name`.putExtra(`key`,variable);
the above command is used to send variables from a using in this key is string and variable can be in any form string,int,array etc. key is used to fetch data in another file
.) Intent abc = getIntent();
above command is used to build an Intent in another file to receive data.
.) `data type` `variable name` = `Intent name`.getStringExtra(`key`);
key = key that you mentioned while sending data
data type = type of data that is being send using the above key
getStringExtra = is used to fetch string data, if any another data is to receive you need to used different method.


**Splash Screen**


it is the screen that is shown every time while opening an app for some amount of time till its files is being loaded.
.) create an activity.
.) from AndroidManifest.xml cut intent-filter from .MainActivity and paste it in new activity that is being created form splash screen
.) make an intent in splash file that link with your main activity(activity that is needed to be shown at first.)
.) if we simply run startActivity(`Intent name`); then our splash screen will never been shown because this procedure is very fast we can't see it'
.) new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable(){
	@Override
	public void run(){
		startActivity(`Intent name`);
		finish();
	}
   }, 3000);
the above is used to create ansynchronous thread which will directy run after 3 sec because we pass 3000 millisecond,
to use thread we need a Runnable class that's why we created a new Runnable and by overriding its run method we run our intent
finish() = is used to pop it from maintained stack of Intents
	if we do not write finish() then when we press back button we will come back to 	our Splash screen, which any developer does not want to happen.


**Animation**


.) Right click on res directory>new>new resource directory  Enter Resource type as "anim" or Directory name as "anim" then ok
it will create an anim directory in which we can create our animations.

.) right click on anim directory>new>Animation resource file name as per your choice then ok
it will create your file where you can create your animation.

.) Animation abc = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this,R.anim.`file name`);
it will create object of the animation that you created.

.)`reference on which you want to apply animation`.startAnimation(`pass object name`);
startAnimation = it will directly start animation.
setAnimation = it will set your animation and start it when object is loaded.

.) Scale Animation
used to make a smaller or larger view either on X-axis or Y-axis.

.) Rotate Animation
used to rotate a view around a pivot point a certain number of degrees.

.) Translate Animation
used to move a view along the X or Y axis.

.) Alpha Animation
Transparency of a view can be changed.

//Attributes\\

.) android:duration = "1000"
The duration in which animation is completed.

.) android:fillAfter = "true"
defines whether the view should be visible or not at the end of animation.

.) android:interpolator = "@android:anim/linear_interpolator"
refers to the rate of change in animation

.) android:startOffset = "2000"
refers to the waiting time before an animation start

.) android:repeatMode = "restart"
Mode of repetition Two types of Modes Restart(default) and Reverse

.)android:repeatCount = "infinite"
defines the number of repetition on animation, we can either give number of iteration or infinite.


//Lottie Animation\\


.) create your id at lottie animation
.) select an animation and change it as your like, install its json file
.) put that json file into R.raw directory
.) from lottie animation GitHub repo copy its dependencies and pste it into build.gradle file
.) now in xml file type lottie via options select whole path to it
.) set its properties
.) set your animation path via using rawRes.


** List **


// ListView \\

.) It is used to show whole list as you made 

// SpinnerView \\

.) It is used to show a dropdown list

// AutoCompleteTextView \\

.) It is used to show a list of recommended item basis of characters you are filling in EditText View.


.) All the above list view have different use case.
.) make these views in xml file, give them id.
.) Fetch there id in java file
.) Create an araay list, add items in it.
.) using arrayadapter set value in the list view

	.) ArrayAdapter<`data type`> `name of adapter` = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, 	   	   android.R.Layout.simple_list_item_1, `id of ArrayList`);
	.) `id of view`.setAdapter(`name of Adapter`);

	this = location from where function is calling
		In place of this we can use(MainActivity.this, getApplicationContext())

	android.R.Layout = is the location from where we can get default view made by 	android itself

	3rd attribute = arraylist which you want to be shown on the screen.


** CardView **


.) use to make card like structure (just like preview cards).

Attributes

.) cardBackgroundColor = defines the background color of card.
.) cardElevation = defines the elevation of the card
.) cardCornerRadius = curveness of the corner of the card
.) carduseCompatPadding = if its value is true it will take default padding which is needed in order to show shadows.

.) pallete > container > CardView 
it is not installed by default to install it go to above location and install it .


** RecyclerView **


.) Create a RecyclerView in activity_main.xml
.) Create variable in MainActivity of your view and find it view via id
.) recContact.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));
	recontact = variable 
	setLayoutManager = there are three types of layouts(Linear, Grid, StaggeredGrid)
.) make a new xml file which includes layout that needed to be use in RecyclerView
.) make a java file which includes all the type of variable used in your layout, build constructor to assign value to this variables.
.) ArrayList<conModel> arrContact = new ArrayList<>();
	make arraylist of the type of java file created before
.) arrContact.add(new conModel(R.drawable.img, "Mayur Rastogi", "1234567890"));
	add elements to the above arraylist by calling constructor build earlier.
.) create a new java file which will work as adapter to our recycler view
.) extend it with RecyclerView.Adapter<`filename`.ViewHolder>
.) then by pressing alt+enter
	it will create class ViewHolder, extends it with RecyclerView.ViewHolder
	create its constructor that assign view to its super view
	it will also create 3 methods named(onCreateViewholder,onBindViewHolder, getItemCount)
.) View v = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.contact_row, parent, false);
ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder(v);
return holder;
	write the above line of code inside onCreateViewHoder
.) holder.conName.setText(arrContact.get(position).conName);
holder.conNumber.setText(arrContact.get(position).conNumber);
holder.conImg.setImageResource(arrContact.get(position).conImg);
	write the above line of code inside onBindViewHolder, these lines are used to 	assign value to the recycler view at run time.
.) return arrContact.size();
	write the above line of code inside the getItemCount
	it will give the size of arraylist, also number of times recycler View needed to be repeated
.) RecConAdapter adapter = new RecConAdapter(this, arrContact);
	above code is used to pass the context to our adapter also arraylist to the adapter which needed to added via our adapter
.) recContact.setAdapter(adapter);
	above line is used to run our adapter
