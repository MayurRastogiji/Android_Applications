**Intent Passing**


it is the procedure via which we can change screen in our android application using any event listner or on the basis of any particular logic.
.) Intent abc = new Intent(`fromclass`.this,`toclass`.class);
the above line is used to create an intent.
.) startActivity(`intent_name`);
the above code is responsible for changing screen


**Bundle Passing**


it is the procedure via which we can send and receive content from 1 java file to another via intent
.) `intent name`.putExtra(`key`,variable);
the above command is used to send variables from a using in this key is string and variable can be in any form string,int,array etc. key is used to fetch data in another file
.) Intent abc = getIntent();
above command is used to build an Intent in another file to receive data.
.) `data type` `variable name` = `Intent name`.getStringExtra(`key`);
key = key that you mentioned while sending data
data type = type of data that is being send using the above key
getStringExtra = is used to fetch string data, if any another data is to receive you need to used different method.


**Splash Screen**


it is the screen that is shown every time while opening an app for some amount of time till its files is being loaded.
.) create an activity.
.) from AndroidManifest.xml cut intent-filter from .MainActivity and paste it in new activity that is being created form splash screen
.) make an intent in splash file that link with your main activity(activity that is needed to be shown at first.)
.) if we simply run startActivity(`Intent name`); then our splash screen will never been shown because this procedure is very fast we can't see it'
.) new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable(){
	@Override
	public void run(){
		startActivity(`Intent name`);
		finish();
	}
   }, 3000);
the above is used to create ansynchronous thread which will directy run after 3 sec because we pass 3000 millisecond,
to use thread we need a Runnable class that's why we created a new Runnable and by overriding its run method we run our intent
finish() = is used to pop it from maintained stack of Intents
	if we do not write finish() then when we press back button we will come back to 	our Splash screen, which any developer does not want to happen.


**Animation**


.) Right click on res directory>new>new resource directory  Enter Resource type as "anim" or Directory name as "anim" then ok
it will create an anim directory in which we can create our animations.

.) right click on anim directory>new>Animation resource file name as per your choice then ok
it will create your file where you can create your animation.

.) Animation abc = AnimationUtils.LoadAnimation(this,R.anim.`file name`);
it will create object of the animation that you created.

.)`reference on which you want to apply animation`.startAnimation(`pass object name`);
startAnimation = it will directly start animation.
setAnimation = it will set your animation and start it when object is loaded.

.) Scale Animation
used to make a smaller or larger view either on X-axis or Y-axis.

.) Rotate Animation
used to rotate a view around a pivot point a certain number of degrees.

.) Translate Animation
used to move a view along the X or Y axis.

.) Alpha Animation
Transparency of a view can be changed.

//Attributes\\

.) android:duration = "1000"
The duration in which animation is completed.

.) android:fillAfter = "true"
defines whether the view should be visible or not at the end of animation.

.) android:interpolator = "@android:anim/linear_interpolator"
refers to the rate of change in animation

.) android:startOffset = "2000"
refers to the waiting time before an animation start

.) android:repeatMode = "restart"
Mode of repetition Two types of Modes Restart(default) and Reverse

.)android:repeatCount = "infinite"
defines the number of repetition on animation, we can either give number of iteration or infinite.
